# Re-Usable Structure Delete Action

In step 2 we're repeating quite a lot of items on all individual pages. We can place them in single partial files and re-use them to better organize the app structure. We'll make new files header.php and footer.php files to contain an app-wide structure. We'll add a tabular format to show the data and delete action to delete the selected record.

## Files:

**config.php**
Holds all the global variables and database connections

**functions.php**
All the functional code 
| Added Table Listing and Delete Actions

**header.php**
Global app header

**footer.php**
Global app footer


**index.php**

**students.php**

**subjects.php**
