# Re-Organising Code

We'll take what we did in the first step and re-organize the code so that there is less clutter on the page and it's easy to manage within a new file called functions.php

## Files:

**config.php**
Holds all the global variables and database connections

**functions.php**
All the functional code 

**index.php**
Search page with a seach form

**students.php**
Student addition form

**subjects.php**
subject addtition form
